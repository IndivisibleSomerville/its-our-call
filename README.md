# its-our-call

[ItsOurCall.org](ItsOurCall.org) is a project of [Indivisible Somerville](indivisiblesomerville.org). This is where we’ll be developing our activism tool. So far, we’ve been designing the idea that’s outlined below. Want to stay updated on our progress? Star this repo or email us at [ItsOurCall@indivisiblesomerville.org](mailto:ItsOurCall@indivisiblesomerville.org).

It’s Our Call aggregates legislators’ stances on hot issues prior to a vote so progressive activists can efficiently shape national policy.

## Sustain motivation
  * The election galvanized people into taking action, but it’s hard to sustain that energy, especially when you don’t know if you’re making a difference.

## See the difference you’re making
  * It’s Our Call highlights our individual and collective action. Each issue page has a live tally of calls made, so that users can see their contribution as soon as they complete a call. 

## Expand the network
  * So many activists are in solidly blue or red areas, where they feel their energy is squandered. Meanwhile, they may have friends with more influenceable legislators, but less inclination to pick up the phone. What would get these passive allies dialing is a friend urging them that this time, their call could be pivotal. Share with friends in priority areas!

# Contribute
  * Look at our issues list. Any issues that don't have an assignee can be claimed.
  * Share us on your social media network of choice!
